	&ldquo;You can talk with someone for years, everyday, and still, it won't mean as much as what you can have when you sit in front of someone, not saying a word, yet you feel that person with your heart, you feel like you have known the person for forever.... connections are made with the heart, not the tongue.&rdquo;<br />- C.

       Know, O Prince, that between the years when the oceans drank Microsoft and the gleaming Windows, and the rise of Ubuntu, there was an Age undreamed of, when shining servers lay spread across the world like blue mantles beneath the stars - Debian, FreeBSD, Slackware, AIX, Solaris with its dark-haired women and towers of spider-haunted mystery, SuSE with its chivalry, Caldera that bordered the pastoral lands of SCO, OpenBSD with its shadow-guarded tombs, RedHat whose Sys Admins wore steel and silk and gold. But the proudest kingdom of the world was OS X, reigning supreme in the dreaming west. Hither came Chris the Texan, little-haired, sullen-eyed, MacBook in hand, a builder, a programmer, an admin, with gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirth, to tread the jewelled server rooms of the earth under his sandled feet.<br />-- By tradition, this has been on every home page I've ever had.
