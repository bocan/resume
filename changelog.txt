-- Version 1 --

* switched to a usable json configuration.
* Modified robots.txt in a possibly vain attempt to block dodgy robots.
* "De-Mac'd" a few files by giving them a newline at the end of the file.
* Added much SEO to both the index and the 404 page.
* Added FUZZYNESS and some cleanup to the 404 page.
* Moved 404 to a more logical place.  Might move it back?
* Removed Pascal's picture.  Added mine.  ;-)
* Removed strange html index file.

-- Version 0 --
