The sheer number of experiences I could have is uncountable, breathtaking, and I'm sitting here refreshing my inbox. We lived trapped in loops, reliving a few days over and over, and we envision only a handful of paths laid out ahead of us. We see the same things each day, we respond the same way, we think the same thoughts, each day a slight variation on the last, every moment smoothly following the gentle curves of societal norms. We act like if we just get through today, tomorrow our dreams will come back to us.  And no, I don't have all the answers. I don't know how to jolt myself into seeing what each moment could become. But I do know one thing: the solution doesn't involve watering down my every little idea and creative impulse for the sake of some day easing my fit into a mold. It doesn't involve tempering my life to better fit someone's expectations. It doesn't involve constantly holding back for fear of shaking things up.  This is very important, so I want to say it as clearly as I can: FUCK. THAT. SHIT.\"",

In a few days I'd written my first programme in Basic and I instantly knew this was what I was going to do with my life. A decade later, after moving to England and getting my permanent residency, I was trained as an Informix 4GL programmer.  While I was good at this, my passion was for doing the more complex systems administration tasks and when Linux starting becoming more popular I was hooked.  I've worked as some form of systems administrator ever since and eventually ended up managing other sys admins. It's paid the bills.  This year, I'm concentrating on learning metric collection tools such as CollectD, InfluxDB, and Grafana, along with various DevOps technologies such as CoreOS, Docker, Vagrant, and possibly Puppet and Elasticsearch.",

I'm also a keen forager of blackberries and plums from roadside trees when they're in season.  During the winter I go sit in my shed in Saturday mornings whist drinking coffee and reading books.

However, in the Summer of 2014, at the age of 41, with painful joints and possibly on the verge of getting diabetes, on the top of a mountain in the Scottish Highlands, I made a decision to lose just a bit more than 4 stone (56 lbs) over the next two years. To that end, I count calories (no fad diets!), avoid processed food in favour of fresh and home-made, walk or cycle or run every single day, and immensely enjoy a bit of yoga at a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wildlotus.co.uk\">new studio</a> in town. I won't lie - it's all bloody hard work.  Failure however isn't even a possibility and a current goal is to achieve 3/4 of my target weight loss by the spring of 2016 and then cycle the length of Wales from Chepstow to Holyhead. To date I've lost around 25 lbs and I'm running a weekly 5k Parkrun race at 37 minutes.  I'd like to get under 25 minutes by this winter!",
